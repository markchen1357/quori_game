<h2>The Cards</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        The cards used in the game are from the game Set and have a series of properties.
        <ul>
            <li>Number of Shapes: 1, 2, 3</li>
            <li>Shading: open, striped, solid</li>

        The game consists of several colored bins (red and orange here) that you must sort the cards into based on their properties.

<h2>The Demonstration Phase</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
        You have a helper robot who will start by demonstrating several different sorts of cards. Pay attention here because it will give you clues as to the rules for which card goes where!

<h2>The Trial Phase</h2>
During the trials, you get to choose where each card goes (left). Your helper robot may give you some feedback after each attempt to help you improve (right).
